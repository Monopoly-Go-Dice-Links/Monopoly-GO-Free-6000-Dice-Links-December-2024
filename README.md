## How to Maximize Your Dice Usage in *Monopoly GO*

Once youâ€™ve received your 6000 dice, here are some strategies to help you make the most out of your bonus:

### 1. **Strategically Use Your Rolls**
Instead of using your dice on every turn, think about the best moments to deploy them. For example, if you're close to a chance card or a spot where you could get a high-value property, save your dice for those turns to make the most impact.

### 2. **Participate in Special Events**

### 4. **Avoid Penalty Spaces**
Some areas on the board can penalize you, such as spaces that send you directly to jail or make you pay taxes. Use your extra dice to avoid these spaces by planning your moves carefully. You can also take advantage of the higher number of rolls to circumvent these challenges and keep your game progressing smoothly.
